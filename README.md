# Java OOP Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of Java practice projects that demonstrate various core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
Each project was created during my academic learning using the NetBeans IDE, applying OOP theory in hands-on coding.

## 🔖 Table of Contents

1. **Even or Odd Checker** – Simple conditionals with encapsulated logic
2. **Student Scores Analyzer** – Array processing with statistics
3. **Array Methods Demo** – Returning and passing arrays
4. **Quadratic & Rectangle** – Constructors, methods, and modular classes
5. **Inheritance with Cylinder & Circle** – Inheritance, overriding, and volume calculations
6. **Shapes with Inheritance & Interfaces** – Full OOP structure using interfaces and hierarchies
7. **Bank Account & Person Validation** – User input + validation logic + account handling
8. **Exception Handling Demo** – Custom exception throws and try-catch-finally

## 🧠 Key OOP Concepts Used

- **Encapsulation** (private fields, getters/setters)
- **Inheritance** (classes like `cylinder extends circle1`)
- **Polymorphism** (interfaces: `shape2`, overridden methods)
- **Abstraction** (using interfaces and class structures)
- **Constructor Overloading & Method Overriding**
- **Exception Handling** (try-catch-finally, custom errors)

## 🗂️ Project Highlights

### 1. Even or Odd Checker
- Input from user → determines even or odd
- Simple method call + scanner
- _Project folder: `even-odd-checker-java`_

### 2. Student Scores Analyzer
- Reads 10 scores, calculates max, min, and average
- Uses `int[]` array and basic loop logic
- _Project folder: `student-scores-analyzer`_

### 3. Array Methods Demo
- Demonstrates passing and returning arrays
- Uses `int[]` and `double[]` arrays
- _Project folder: `array-methods-demo`_

### 4. Quadratic & Rectangle
- Class `qudratic` calculates roots
- Class `rectangle` with area and perimeter
- _Project folder: `oop-quadratic-and-rectangle-demo`_

### 5. Inheritance: Cylinder & Circle
- Class `cylinder` inherits from `circle1`
- Method overriding and volume calculation
- _Project folder: `inheritance-cylinder-circle-demo`_

### 6. Shapes – Inheritance & Interfaces
- Uses interface `shape2`
- Classes like `rectangle`, `square`, `circle` use inheritance and override
- _Project folder: `oop-shapes-inheritance-interface`_

### 7. Bank Account & Person Validation
- Class `bankacount` for deposit/withdraw
- Class `person` for validating phone/email/age/name
- Class `BirthDate` for date verification
- _Project folder: `bank-account-and-person-data-validation`_

### 8. Exception Handling Demo
- Method `getAverage()` throws exceptions for invalid inputs
- Try-catch blocks for built-in Java exceptions
- _Project folder: `java-exception-handling-demo`_
